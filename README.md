# ReadMeGenerator-

The ReadMe generator was created to help users populate a fully functional read me with ease.

The generator will ask the name of the project, which contributions have been made, what testing has been done for it, the creator's GitHub username, how the app will be used, which licesnure would be used and what email the creator can be contacted all.
All important information for a good ReadMe file.
This generator can be accessed by using Node and the keyboard with arrow keys.
